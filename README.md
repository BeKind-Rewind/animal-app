# News Buddy

We created an app where users can search current top news articles and stories from the New York Times. With the overwhelming majority of news stories recently having a negative impact on our stress levels and mental health in general, our app provides a little levity by inviting users to "click" to *retrieve* a News Buddy - a.k.a a random doggo (img) - that will help bring that seratonin and hopefully a smile to our users faces.

Users can see and *retrieve* their previous article searches for future reference. 

We used HTML, Tailwindcss, JavaScript to dynamically add elements and interact with the APIs. 

# Future features

Users click a button to retrieve articles.
Sortable: "Multiple Containers" and "Transformed" to save articles gallery
